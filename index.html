            <h1>Portfolio for COP 4813: Internet Programming</h1><br>
            <a href="assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a>
            <p>Assignment 1 was designed to teach us the fundamentals of HTML and CSS so that we would have a firm foundation to base to build upon when we delve deeper into the class of internet programming.</p>

            <p>The HTML portion of the assignment required us to create a static page utilizing headers, email to links, images, hyper links, and tables. I also added divs to better seperate each section and to give the website more clear cut idea of where each section ended.</p>

            <p>The CSS portion of the assignment required us to modify the appearance of multiple items and sections of the page to give it a unique but cohesive look that would set it apart from other pages online. </p><br>

            <p>Learning Objectives</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create basic HTML pages utilizing the design practices learned from the material</li>
              <li>Create a basic style sheet to apply a cohesive and unique feel to the HTML pages creted.</li>
              <li>Learning the folder structure and how to navigate a Linux server through secure shell</li>
            </ul><br>
            <hr>
            <a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a>
            <p>Assignment 2 was designed to teach us the fundamentals of Javascript by creating a form utilizing text boxes, radio buttons, drop down menues, and functions that process all the information provided through those options. </p><br>

            <p>Learning Objectives</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create basic forms to collect information</li>
              <li>Use textboxes, radio buttons, check boxes, and drop down menues</li>
              <li>Utilize a reset button and submit buttion to modify the information in the form</li>
              <li>Create a flow chart that illustrate the decision structure of the script</li>
            </ul> 
            <hr>
            <a href="assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a>
            <p>Assignment 3 was designed to teach us the more advanced javascript techniques of manipulating arrays, creating functions, utilzing user input, and providing results from the user input using the functions created. </p><br>

            <p>Learning Objectives</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create basic forms to collect information from user</li>
              <li>Create mathematical functions that used the user input</li>
              <li>Provide the results of their input in designated textboxes</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="assign4/index.php">Assignment 4</a>
            <p>Assignment 4 was about introducing the canvas element and how to create and manipulate animations with what we've learned thus far. I chose to create a paint canvas to emphasize the creativity within the field of development and how design, aesthetic design, is just as important as technical knowledge. </p><br>

            <p>Learning Objectives</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create animation with the html5 canvas tag</li>
              <li>Utilize javascript, or jquery, to execute the canvas functions.</li>
            </ul> 
            <hr>
            <a href="assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a>
            <p>Assignment 5 introduced PHP and server side programing. We had to create a basic log in page that verified a user's credentials and allowed them into a stock portfolio. From there they will be able to add/modify/delete stocks from their portfolio. I used a drop down menu with a select number of stocks so that the user wouldn't have to go look up company stock symbols to test the functionality of the code. The only valid credentials are the following:
            <br><br>Username: Alan<br>Password:Turing</p><br>

            <p>Learning Objectives</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a basic php file and utilize input from the user.</li>
              <li>Create basic php scripts and functions to manipulate user input</li>
                <li>Utilize a Yahoo finance script to dynamically pull stock data.</li>
            </ul>
