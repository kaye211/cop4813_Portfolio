        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I'm married to Elizabeh Zank and the father of two handsome boys, Joshua and Roland. I was born in Olongapo, Phillipines on November 29th, 1987 but have lived in Orange Park, Florida since April 1998 and graduated from Orange Park High School in 2006. Afterwards, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a Field Radio Operator and served in the 4th Marine Logistics Group, 4th Landing Support Battalion, 2nd Beach and Terimnal Operations, Bravo Company located in Savannah, Georgia until May, 2012. Afterwards, I later persued higher education and finished my general education at St. John's State College and transferred to University of North Florida on January, 2014.</p> 

        <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computing and Information Sciences, concentrating on Information Technology with a focus in Security. Although originally wishing to pursue a major in Computer Science so that I could enter the field of software development, I realized that perhaps a career in the security field may be just as fun and interesting. I'm curretnly working part time at the Help Desk for UNF's IT department.</p>

        <p>I'm currently planning on graduating in the spring of 2016 and hoping to pursue a career in the IT security field. Eventually I would like to give back to the community and find some way to teach kids in high school and junior high how fun the computing field is, whether in some sort of after school program or becoming a teacher later.</p><br><br>
